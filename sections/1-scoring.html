      <h2>What is Football?</h2>
      <p>Two teams of 11 players take turns on <span class="term" data-term="offense">offense</span> (trying to score) and <span class="term" data-term="defense">defense</span> (trying to stop them). The offense moves the ball down the field toward the opponent's <span class="term" data-term="end-zone">end zone</span>.</p>

      <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
      <p>The offense gets <strong>4 attempts</strong> (called <span class="term" data-term="down">downs</span>) to move the ball <strong>10 yards</strong>. Make it 10 yards? You get 4 more tries. Fail? The other team gets the ball.</p>
      <p>Most plays are either a <strong>run</strong> (hand the ball to a runner) or a <strong>pass</strong> (throw it to a receiver). The defense tries to stop both.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>How Scoring Works</h2>
    <p>The goal is simple: get the ball into the <span class="term" data-term="end-zone">end zone</span> to score.</p>

      <h2>Who Is This For?</h2>
      <p>You've watched a football game. You know touchdowns are good. But you want to understand <em>why</em> things happen:</p>
      <ul class="what-youll-learn">
        <li>Will they run or pass?</li>
        <li>Why did the QB throw <em>there</em>?</li>
        <li>What is the defense trying to do?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This guide will help you <strong>predict what's coming</strong> before the play happens.</p>
