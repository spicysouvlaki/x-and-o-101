    "correct": "Corner Route",
    "explanation": "Corner route attacks the Cover 2 hole between the corner and safety. In a 2-minute drill down by 4, this sideline throw stops the clock and moves you into field goal range. The drag is covered by the flat defender, and seam has two safeties over the top."

    "answers": ["Fade Route", "Slant Route", "Flat Route", "Power Run"],
    "correct": "Fade Route",
    "explanation": "Goal line fade beats tight man coverage at the pylon. The receiver has inside leverage and the safety can't help in the compressed field. Slant risks a pick-6 in tight quarters, and the defense is stacking the box expecting run."

    "answers": ["Post Route", "Screen", "Out Route", "Slant Route"],
    "correct": "Post Route",
    "explanation": "Against Cover 1 with single-high safety, the post route attacks the deep middle. The safety has to respect both sides, creating a window. Backed up with time running, you need chunk plays - the screen is too risky near your own end zone if blown up."

    "answers": ["QB Power", "Counter", "Inside Zone", "Draw Play"],
    "correct": "Counter",
    "explanation": "Counter misdirection freezes the Cover 3 linebackers reading run. The play-side linebacker bites on the fake, opening the cutback lane. QB Power telegraphs the direction, and inside zone gets swallowed in a stacked box. Must convert to stay in the game."

    "answers": ["Corner Route", "Flat Route", "Seam Route", "Post Route"],
    "correct": "Flat Route",
    "explanation": "In Cover 3, the flat defender has to cover a lot of ground. Trips formation overloads one side, and the flat route gets the ball out quick to the RB in space. The corner and post have defenders in position, but the flat is a high-percentage throw that can get the first down with YAC."
